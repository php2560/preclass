This week before coming to class your will prepare 2 different types of work prior to coming to class. We will:

1. Start the R-Package Project
2. Figure out Groups and evaluate previous Shiny Apps. 


# R Packages

## Reading

For your Reading:

- [RStudio Package Creation](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-RStudio)
- [MIT Package Step-by-Step Guide](http://web.mit.edu/insong/www/pdf/rpackage_instructions.pdf)
- [Karl Broman Package Primer](http://kbroman.org/pkg_primer/)
- [Hadley Wickham Package Creation Book](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/)


# Shiny Project



1. As a group your first task will be to come up with an idea for a Shiny app and to write the code for this. In order to facilitate this more I will provide some structure. 
    - Your app must allow a researcher to use their own inputs. 
    - Your app must display some type of interactive user interface aspects. 
        - For example - [Normal Calculator](https://www.sullivanstatistics.com/shiny/normcalc/): In this app I created depending on where the researcher wants to shade the normal distribution different boxes will pop up after the researcher makes a choice. 
    - You app must display graphical as well as statistical output. 
    - Your app must not be created copying code from an example app that is out there.
        - We want to make sure you are not plagerizing. In the Normal Calculator app I provided, it appears similar to the DistCalc app from the shiny gallery, however the code behind it comes from my own code and graphing work that I have done in the past. None was copied or pasted from another Shiny app.
    - Your app must function properly and be useful. 
    - Your app must run quickly and not be bulky.
    - Your app should be easy to use or contain detailed instructions.
2. Go through all of the [past Shiny Apps created in PHP 2560](https://github.com/php2560/Final_Projects)
    - Go into the code and download all of the necessary packages to make them run. 
    - Run them using the commands in the README.md file of the repository. 
    - Write a one paragraph critique of the app.
        - Was it easy to use?
        - Was it fast to use?
        - How was the look and feel of it.
